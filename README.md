# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice (Java)

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems implemented in **Java** as part of my placement preparation.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation in commonly asked interview patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving ability
- Practice coding interview questions using Java
- Understand time and space complexity
- Learn common DSA patterns used in technical interviews
- Track daily progress consistently

---

## 🛠️ Language Used

- Java

---

## 📂 Problem Categories

Problems are organized based on commonly used DSA patterns:

- Arrays
- Strings
- HashMap
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Queue
- Recursion *(to be added)*

---

## 📅 Day 01 Progress

### ✅ Two Sum (HashMap Approach)
- Implemented solution using HashMap for efficient lookup
- Learned complement logic (target - current element)
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

---

### ✅ Valid Palindrome (Two Pointer Approach)
- Implemented using Two Pointer technique
- Ignored non-alphanumeric characters
- Compared characters from both ends of the string
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

---

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- HashMap usage in Java
- Two Pointer Technique
- String manipulation
- Time and Space Complexity analysis

---

## 🚀 Future Plan

- Continue solving Array-based problems
- Move to Two Pointer pattern
- Practice Hashing & Sliding Window problems
- Solve Medium level questions

---

📌 This repository will be updated regularly with new problem solutions.
